          Rajinikanth is an Indian actor who has appeared in over 160 films,
          predominantly in Tamil cinema.[1] He began his film career by playing
          antagonistic and supporting roles before graduating to a lead
          actor.[2] After starring in numerous commercially successful films
          throughout the 1980s and 1990s, he has continued to hold a matinée
          idol status in the popular culture of Tamil Nadu.[3] Writing for
          Slate, Grady Hendrix called him the "biggest movie star you've
          probably never heard of."[4] Rajinikanth has also worked in other
          Indian film industries such as Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and
          Bengali.[5] He made his cinematic debut with K. Balachander's 1975
          Tamil drama Apoorva Raagangal, in which he played a minor role of an
          abusive husband.[6][7] He had his first major role in Balachander's
          Telugu drama film Anthuleni Katha (1976), and got his breakthrough in
          Tamil with Moondru Mudichu (1976)—also directed by Balachander. His
          style and mannerisms in the latter earned recognition from the
          audience.[8] In 1977, he acted in 15 films, playing negative
          characters in most of them, including Avargal, 16 Vayathinile, Aadu
          Puli Attam and Gaayathri.[2][6] He had positive roles in Kavikkuyil,
          the Kannada film Sahodarara Savaal,[9] and the Telugu film Chilakamma
          Cheppindi, in which he played the protagonist for the first time in
          his career.[10] His role as a failed lover in S. P. Muthuraman's
          Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri (1977) won him critical acclaim.[11] In 1978,
          he was cast as the main lead in the Tamil film Bairavi.[2] The same
          year, he received critical acclaim for his roles in Mullum Malarum and
          Aval Appadithan; the former earned him a Tamil Nadu State Film Award
          Special Prize for Best Actor.[6] He made his Malayalam cinema debut
          with I. V. Sasi's fantasy Allauddinum Albhutha Vilakkum (1979), an
          adaptation of a story from One Thousand and One Nights.[12][13] By the
          end of the decade, he had worked in all South Indian languages and
          established a career in Tamil cinema.[6][14] He played dual roles in
          the action thriller Billa (1980), which was a remake of the Bollywood
          film Don (1978). It was his biggest commercial success to that point
          and gave him the action hero image.[15][16] Murattu Kaalai released in
          1980 was instrumental in establishing Rajinikanth as both an action
          hero and superstar. Balachander's Thillu Mullu (1981), the Tamil
          remake of the Bollywood film Gol Maal (1979), was Rajinikanth's first
          full-length comedy film.[17] He played triple roles in the 1982 Tamil
          film Moondru Mugam, which earned him a special prize at the Tamil Nadu
          State Film Awards ceremony. The following year, he made his Bollywood
          debut with T. Rama Rao's Andhaa Kaanoon; it was among the top-grossing
          Bollywood films in 1983.[18] Muthuraman's Nallavanukku Nallavan (1984)
          won him that year's Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actor.[5] In 1985,
          he portrayed the Hindu saint Raghavendra Swami in his 100th film Sri
          Raghavendrar,[19] a box-office failure.[20] In the latter half of the
          1980s, he starred in several films in Tamil and Hindi, including
          Geraftaar (1985), Bewafai (1985), Padikkadavan (1985), Mr. Bharath
          (1986), Velaikaran (1987), Manithan (1987), Guru Sishyan (1988),
          Dharmathin Thalaivan (1988) and ChaalBaaz (1989).[21] During this
          time, he made his debut in American cinema with a supporting role in
          the mystery adventure film Bloodstone (1988), a box-office
          failure.[22] Rajinikanth continued to act in Bollywood, often playing
          supporting roles in films such as Hum, and Phool Bane Angaray (both in
          1991). Mani Ratnam's Tamil film Thalapathi (1991), based on the Indian
          epic Mahabharata, earned him critical acclaim.[22] Suresh Krissna's
          Annaamalai (1992), P. Vasu's Mannan (1992) and Uzhaippali (1993) are
          among his box-office successes in Tamil.[23] He made his debut as a
          screenwriter with Valli (1993), a commercial failure.[a][13] The
          Suresh Krissna-directed Baashha, in which he played a crime boss, was
          a major commercial success in his career and earned him a "demigod"
          status in Tamil Nadu.[23] Later that year he acted in K. S.
          Ravikumar's Muthu, which was dubbed into Japanese.[b] In Japan, the
          film grossed a record US$1.6 million in 1998 and was largely
          instrumental in creating a fan-base for Rajinikanth in the
          country.[25] Padayappa (1999), his second collaboration with
          Ravikumar, went on to become the highest-grossing Tamil film to that
          point.[26] In 2002 Rajinikanth produced, wrote and starred in the
          fantasy thriller Baba,[27] which fell short of market expectations and
          incurred heavy losses for its distributors.[28] After a three-year
          sabbatical, he returned to acting with the comedy horror film
          Chandramukhi (2005); it went on to become the highest-grossing Tamil
          film to that point,[26] and its theatrical run lasted 126 weeks at
          Shanti Theatre in Chennai.[c] Rajinikanth was paid ₹26 crore for his
          role in S. Shankar's Sivaji (2007), which made him the second-highest
          paid actor in Asia after Jackie Chan.[30] He played dual roles, as a
          scientist and an andro-humanoid robot, in the science fiction film
          Enthiran (2010). It was India's most expensive production at the time
          of its release,[31] and is among the highest-grossing Indian films of
          all time.[d][33] He played triple roles in the 2014 animated film
          Kochadaiiyaan, the first in India to be shot with motion capture
          technology;[34] it was a commercial failure.[35] Two years later,
          Rajinikanth played a Malaysian Tamil crime boss in Pa. Ranjith's
          Kabali,[36] which had the biggest weekend opening for an Indian film
